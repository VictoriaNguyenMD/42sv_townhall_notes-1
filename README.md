### Other CYD stuff
* Game zone is locked for people currently on CYD

* When you message the bocal bot, include the reason why so they know who should respond. 

## Dormitory stuff

* Cantina feedback: make your voice heard at https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfnuSYgydSgr57v7mDLI0AVlqgob03_xdXokt3Tn1BlBjkoHg/viewform?usp=sf_link
* Don't go into the annex next to the cantina
* Don't dispose of furniture, hazardous waste, or anything bigger than a large trash bag at the dumpsters. It costs the school a lot of money that could be spent on better things.
	* Check the rules on how to throw stuff away at on https://meta.intra.42.fr/articles
* Dormitory hallway
	* Don't put stuff in the dorm hallway such as furniture, shoes, etc. etc. etc. Rugs are allowed. This is a fire code regulation.

# Questions

*Vote tallies as of 12:45pm*

### Can we stay in dorms while we have an internship? What are the dorm requirments for interns?

29 upvotes | 0 downvotes [Anonymous -- Sep 10, 2019, 6:04:00 PM]

*A:* (Be level 7). Upload your contract. If your internship hours will mess with your ability to keep up with academics, talk to bocal. Internship responsibilities do not contribute to CYD requirements. Once you upload your contract, you have 30 days where you're completely whitelisted from CYD to earn two paychecks and move out. But if you're working, you don't need to be in the dorms.

### When will the wifi be back up for people who're actually working and want to have some time off in the evening at the dorms ? Thanks.

28 upvotes | 3 downvotes [Anonymous -- Sep 10, 2019, 5:54:50 PM]

*A:* The wifi will be back when the number of people on CYD is better. CYD will be run on Monday (?), if the numbers are better then the wifi will be turned back on.

Bocal is updating check your dorms to be combined with black hole, so you'll only have one system/set of rules. It will still be strict.

People are taking too long on projects, especially with early projects. It shouldn't take 3 months to do libft.

If you're hanging out in the lab watching YouTube, you're wasting time. Time is the only thing you can't buy, so why would you waste it?

For completing projects: Don't feel like you have to do bonuses. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good. Get the projects done.

No one cares about printf. No one's gonna look at that on your resume/github and be impressed. Get it done and move on to other projects.

If you see someone in the lab who's spending the whole day on YouTube/Facebook, talk to them, ask them what they're working on, tell them to get on with it.

Response question: the number of people on CYD has gone up, but how many more students have been added?
Answer: Bocal doesn't know off the top of our heads, but the number of people in the dorms has stayed about the same over the last three months.

### Case 1: With the new graph arriving,  will cadets be able to subscribe to projects from the old(current) graph? Can we have infos on how the transition will occurs?

24 upvotes | 0 downvotes [Anonymous -- Sep 10, 2019, 6:09:28 PM]

A: It's still up in the air. The transition will happen mid-October to November. Bocal doesn't know details yet. There will be multiple circles and each circle will have some projects and an exam. The exam will change (but we don't know how much yet). You start at the center circle. Once you pass all projects and exams of a circle, you progress to the next circle. The circles will be consistent across campuses, but at the outside of the circles, campuses will get to choose their own projects a bit.

It's not totally clear how the transition will go yet.

### We have high turnover(people quitting), I think it's a problem. Is this something that is trying to be fixed, and if so how?

24 upvotes | 1 downvotes [Michael Brave -- Sep 10, 2019, 7:01:25 PM]

*A:* Rene: We are a community. We're a family. Help each other out. There's a lot of tension, a lot of poeple freaking out with CYD. Help each other out. Talk to someone. I'm here if anyone needs someone to talk to. Talk to people, expand your network, and have fun. You're here to learn, so if you don't reach out you won't grow as a person.

Leo: Companies hire people based on personality. If you have the mentality of "I'm not spending time helping this other person since it won't benefit me", no one will want to hire you. Be a good person, it will make your life better as well as the lives of the people around you. [paraphrased very roughly --evjohnst]

### I've heard that people in trailers are about to be held to the same requirements as people living in the dorms. When will this be implemented?

22 upvotes | 2 downvotes [Anonymous -- Sep 10, 2019, 8:32:52 PM]

### Bocal seems to often forget about agreements, or change their mind after they promise something. People have to screenshot all conversation with Bocal so they have proof that it happened. Why aren't agreements tracked & honored consistently?

### Case 0: How many CYD do need to be kicked out ?

22 upvotes | 5 downvotes [Anonymous -- Sep 10, 2019, 5:58:27 PM]

---

### Case 2: What are the basic steps and requirements to transfer to another campus, and which  campuses can when transfer to ?

14 upvotes | 3 downvotes [Anonymous -- Sep 10, 2019, 6:28:23 PM]

*A:* Transfers to other campuses will have to be approved by your home campus, who will send a request to the other campus.

---

### Students are on CYD for different reasons. But is there a statistic or common factor among CYD students? As in, are most students on CYD because exams were missed, levels weren't met, or lab hours weren't met? So appropriate action can be taken to ensure students can improve instead of taking wifi

### Does the automated CYD system account for lab closures like the heat wave?

### The Geneva Convention protects prisoners of war from collective punishment—a form of punishment shown to also be pretty ineffective. Perhaps we could extend such freedoms to 42 cadets?

18 upvotes | 10 downvotes [Anonymous -- Sep 10, 2019, 7:42:52 PM]

*A:* Jamie: This question is offensive. If you feel like a prisoner of war, get out.

### What kind of equipment is allow in the dorm? I heard someone said microwave and rice cooker is allowed, but I also heard it is not allow. Could we have a clear form to state what is forbidden and what is allow?

15 upvotes | 9 downvotes [Anonymous -- Sep 10, 2019, 7:14:59 PM]

### Why was the extension cord being used at the patio taken away? That belonged to a pisciner who left it for the community.

7 upvotes | 1 downvotes [Anonymous -- Sep 11, 2019, 8:36:11 PM]

### What happens if we fail CYD? How long do we have to find a new place to live?

11 upvotes | 6 downvotes [Anonymous -- Sep 10, 2019, 6:04:20 PM]

*A:* Talk to bocal. Failing CYD doesn't necessarily mean that you'll be kicked out of the dorms, and passing CYD doesn't necessarily mean that you will be kicked out of the dorms.

On CYD grading: if you give someone a 4/5 on any slider, they fail CYD. This doesn't mean they get kicked out of the dorms. Grading CYD is an opportunity to check in with people and find out whether they are taking a good approach to their academics, and help them to find ways they could improve. Students who grade CYD are not deciding whether or not their evaluees get kicked out of the dorms. That's bocal's job.

### Is the blackhole system going to change like it is changing in Paris? And if yes, is it going to be applicable only to new cadets or to all of us? Also, do you know how is the new blackhole system going to work?
8 upvotes | 3 downvotes [Anonymous -- Sep 10, 2019, 10:32:49 PM]

*A:* Black hole system will be changing. This is still in development, so bocal doesn't know exactly how it will go, but this is the current idea:

Each person who starts at 42 will have a certain amount of buffer time, and each project you do will give you more buffer time. As time passes, your buffer will decrease, and when it hits zero you will be put on black hole.

You will be able to put your curriculum on hold and pause the buffer decay up to 3 times.

### CYD is part of the program. Its a way to put ourselves to check. People who got it deserve it. No questions about that. But what about making it fair for everyone. What about the people staying in dorm and working? No hours at the lab, no levels. Just because u are a friend of Micheal, u get a pass?

### I am curious. What can we do as a community (bocal included) to help each other if/when others are struggling? Would our community value the direct mentoring of others, by those better versed in/on the subject? What should we do if we are stuck somewhere, and the only alternative is to "git gud?"

### Can we please write down the dorm requirements in the rules so that it is accessible for reference? Many people have gotten conflicting messages about what they are (e.g. two tests per month vs. two tests per 4 weeks, one level per month vs. one project per month, etc.)

### Could we give the dorm students \~10 days per year for No Questions Asked sick days? (these could be applied immediately) It's hard to keep working when you're burnt out but feel you have to to avoid CYD. I personally can't take a day off without feeling guilty that I'm not working hard enough

### Speech from ztisnes

[These are Zeid's notes, not my transcription. --evjohnst]

I'm here to talk about an important topic related to our community mindset. As a 42 student, who grew thinking about what I want to bring to the table, I had nothing and felt useless at many stages in life. The only thing I'm useful is by satisfying the needs of others. I always wanted to be part of a "perfect world" where there is no fear to lose anything. I came to a close-minded family where the importance of humanity was lackful and doesn't believe about science. I was always kept in the quiet and difficult to speak up because "I don't make sense" or it was too abstract. Now that I'm away, I learned a few lessons and grew on my own to be able to speak out my thoughts and nail it down. Lately, I noticed that are mad about academics or CYD or other things. I'm not bringing those topics here. I'm bringing you up the fear of losing our home, which is happening right now on this planet. I want you to understand that we are ALL in a tough situation where our house is literally burning. All of us wants to have a job and make tons of money, leave school, and don't worry about anything at all that is happening around the world. I'm here to speak about the climate crisis and how it is impacting our human civilization. We are all human beings and we have achieved so many things together from past generations. I don't want your help. I want you to panic and react when it is too late. The IPCC scientific studies say we have 11 years until we can revert the CO2 emissions curve. Otherwise, we have an irreversible state that humans can not control in the future. This is the moment to wake up and change the ways we see and think because all we think is that the current world is perfect. Everyone says life is black and white, but that is a lie and a serious lie. Avoid the world's temperature or not, avoid an irrevocable chain reaction of human control or not, choosing to continue our civilization or not. This is unquestionably in our reach. There is no gray area when it comes to survival. Now we have the possibility to choose. We learn from failing right? Then how we are failing to help our actual home in general and just waiting to see it worse? People told me they would help, but they end up lying in themselves and denying what is happening outside of our school or even homes. Your precautions are needed if we want to survive longer on this planet, otherwise, we will face the sixth mass extinction on Earth thanks to us. We are not consciously thinking of the potential risks in the long term to avoid this problem and pretend in a lying world. The higher your carbon footprint, the greater moral duty you will have. Your silence is the worst after all. The future of us is falling into our hands. Only we care to talk about the economic growth in entirety because it scares us to be unpopular and just to move on like nothing happened as it is ok. We are about to sacrifice our people for opportunities to win big numbers. The change will happen, like it or not. I'm just a student who is hoping to have a future and able to help the world from the current climate situation we are in. simple enough, there is not enough time to hope we will be in charge. I'm not a puppet playing around to be controlled by some system and have been told that I'm wasting my time by doing this. We cheat ourselves to pretend we are winning this fight and carry on thinking it is all about acquiring power. The system now is all about competition. Where is the compassion and mission to become a "disruptive school"? Why haven't we thought of having a green technology projects like some alumni students (tower farm) in the branch/holy graph? Why this is not a priority for the sake of every one of us and future education? This is the biggest challenge in our lives now and it is important to promote to the public audience to understand. I don't want your cheers, optimism, or joy; I want you to feel fear and panic every day and then act. Act as our humanity is on the brink of extinction because it is. Thank you.
