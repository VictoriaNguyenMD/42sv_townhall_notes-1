## Most Recent Townhall (2019.07.22)

##### AC problems; lab closures; rules/FAQs added to meta.intra.42.fr; etc.

### Announcements

More people registered for the town hall than came; staff takes time out of their day so make sure to come. [transcriber's note: a lot more people showed up after this, so I guess just be on time next time?]

Movie club is re-opened! It's not just movies though, can be movies, video games, karaoke, etc. Hours 5pm-11pm, gaming after 6pm. Check out #movies on Slack, and reach out to Michael if you have any questions.

Policies, guidelines, rules, FAQs, etc. are now available on Intra: https://meta.intra.42.fr/. To get there, click on the compass! If anything is unclear, message @Bocal on Slack.

##### Nostromo residents:
* Clean your rooms! If you have moldy food in your room, or you can't see your floor, fix it.
* Make sure there's nothing obstructing doorways. Don't run the AC with the window open. Don't run the AC when no one's in the room. 
* No alocohol in the dorms, including empty containers. If you are found with alcohol in the dorms, you will be evicted from the dorms and locked out of the curriclum for three months. This is because we have underage people in the dorms, and if we don't enforce this rule it puts the whole dorms at risk. Don't drink in the dorms so they don't get closed down.
* Don't let people squat in your rooms. You will be evicted. No wiggle room on this whatsoever.
* New washing machines/driers are coming the week of August 19th. It will cost $1 to wash, $1 to dry.

Do not smoke within 50 feet of the dorms, within 50 feet of the lab, or near the entryway/main exit for the lab. Also, clean up your cigarette butts.

##### 42 Accelerate
* Run by Jin Zheng (jzheng)
* Startup incubator run by the school
* Requirements: level 7 + passing the beginner exam (all 5 times)

##### Mini-Machine Learning Piscine
* Starts Wednesday, requirements are level 5 + passing the intermediate exam at least once.
* If you have questions, talk to @dan on Slack.

When messaging the @Bocal, @Percy, or @Mother bots, you don't need to send multiple messages. Session expiration DOES NOT mean you need to send another message, or that your issue won't be addressed, it just means that edits and reactions won't be updated. If you message @Bocal on the weekend, you might have to wait until Monday for a response.

Tri-City Health Center will be in the lab every new cadet start date, and they can help you with problems with health care, food, etc. They turn no one away.

Why the lab/zone closures? The AC is down. Bocal is working on it, they'll be making adjustments, please be patient while it's getting figured it out.

### Q & A

##### Can we have a mentor program at 42?
* Yes! We will have outside mentors coming in Tuesday/Thursday evenings to mentor cadets. Keep an eye on Slack for more details as they get finalized.

##### Can we turn off the lights in the lab during the day to reduce waste heat?
* We can't turn the lights off all the time; there are tours coming through etc. Bocal will look at turning off the lights some of the time.

##### Allow students to work downstairs where the AC works better?
* No, the computers can't be secured against being stolen downstairs.

##### Can we have a silent cluster downstairs? People are playing guitar, being loud, etc.
* No, same reason as above. If people are being loud, remind them that it's a working space and they need to be respectful of others. Take care of the lab yourself. You're adults, handle it in an adult way. If you try to handle it yourself and it doesn't work, then it is okay to ask bocal for help.
* If the pisciners are being loud, talk to them yourself, or ask a prefect to talk to them.

##### Are the hours expectations going to be reduced given the lab closures?
* If you have problems with hours due to lab closures, COMMUNICATE WITH BOCAL. If you have problems due to your work schedule, show Bocal your work schedule and something can be worked out.

##### Regarding the lab closures: Closing the lab at night is effective at reducing daytime heat, bocal has been doing tests. Daytime temperature went from around 90°F to 78°F after the first nighttime lab closure.

##### Could Bocal blog/post what's being tried, how effective it is, etc.?
* Bocal would like to, but often when they do that, people get really aggressive in how they respond to it. If the conversation stays professional, bocal will be more willing to share data.

##### What's the emergency response plan in case of earthquake?
* Kim and Manny are working on putting a complete plan together, but... in the case of earthquake stand in a doorway or get under a desk. Don't exit the building; aftershocks are a thing!
* Also, you can do your own research. When you move somewhere new, google what the local natural disasters are and how to handle them.

##### Why devote all of Zone 1 to 20 new cadets?
* So they can work together. Bocal is hoping this improves their onboarding experience. Other cadets will now be allowed to sit in the whole zone.

##### How often will we keep having changes in where people are allowed to sit?
* As we figure out the temperature situation, it will keep changing, so no promises for now. That said, the goal is to figure out what works and make that the new normal.

##### Why can't cadets sit in Zone 4?
* The computers aren't all set up correctly for regular cadets (lab hours, apps, etc). Also, they need to change stuff around in Zone 4 frequently, so it's better to have that affect as few people as possible.

##### Can we get door access from ft_patio back into the building?
* No updates yet, but something's in the works.

##### How did someone get to level 21 without doing internships like it says you have to on the website?
* Internships are not required here; Bocal will update the website.

##### To what extent does Paris still have control over our curriculum given the announcement of 42 Network?
* Some projects are specific to this campus, they might get moved to the outer ring of projects. A lot of the network schools are new and still figuring things out, so we'll update as we find out more. [transcriber's note: I think I missed some stuff here, please let me know if you have anything to add]

##### Any updates on fixing all the doors to work with the keyfobs?
* Not really. It's still in-process; Bocal is currently getting quotes on how much it'll cost, etc.

##### Why does the Check Your Dorms corrections page have sliders when anything less than 5/5 is a fail?
* CYD sliders will be changed to yes/no.

##### Some people feel unsafe asking questions on Slack. What can we do about this?
* Yes, there is some hostility. We need to work on this as a group. Talk to your peers, the change starts with students. If that's not enough, talk to bocal. Bocal isn't always watching Slack, so loop them in when there's a problem. Bocal won't implement community moderators because this needs to be a community effort, and empowering some students over others drives a wedge between them. Moderate with your words.
